- **Stage 7**: 1 week (Deployment)

**Total Estimated Time**: 8-12 weeks for full development

## **Getting Started Next Steps**

1. **Set up development environment** (Python + Node.js)
2. **Start with Stage 1, Task 1.1** - Basic FastAPI server
3. **Test early and often** - Get friends to test each stage
4. **Focus on MVP first** - Don't get caught up in advanced features initially
5. **Document your API** - FastAPI auto-generates great docs
